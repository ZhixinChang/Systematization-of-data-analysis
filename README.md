# Systematization-of-data-analysis
Methodology for the entire process system of data-driven decision-making.

## What can this do for you?
In practical data application scenarios, the specific definition of the entire data analysis process system and its components has been clarified, promoting data-driven value presentation, transmission, and circulation, and facilitating better data-driven decision-making.

### Suitable Audience
- Data analyst.
- Data scientist.
- Enthusiasts dedicated to data science applications.

## Getting Started
The data-driven decision-making process system consists of three stages: cognitive insight, strategy validation, and experimental drilling. In addition, it also includes three supporting components: analytical ability, data warehouse, and indicator system. And we implement the application of data-driven decision-making in three stages through these supporting components.

### Stages
| Stages | Target | Details |
|:------:|--------|:-------:|
| cognitive insight | 1. Determine the priority of optimizing multiple performance indicators.<br>2. Evaluate the impact of work indicators on business indicators.<br>3. Reveal the optimization space of work indicators. | [Learn more][cognitive insight] |
| strategy validation | 1. Design AB testing for strategy optimization.<br>2. Evaluate the impact of strategy AB testing. | [Learn more][strategy validation] |
| experimental drilling | 1. Reveal the impact chain and degree of strategies on business.<br>2. Identify sensitive populations for strategies/indicators. | [Learn more][experimental drilling] |

### Supporting components
| Components | Target | Details |
|:----------:|--------|:-------:|
| analytical ability | The application capabilities of algorithms such as causal inference, machine learning, and operations research optimization are not just limited to the current situation. | [Learn more][analytical ability] |
| data warehouse | The thinking of data processing pipeline is to ensure the reliability of data results, rather than fragmented data extraction and processing. | [Learn more][data warehouse] |
| indicator system | Quantify all things that can do work as work indicators, and improve business indicators by intervening in work indicators. | [Learn more][indicator system] |
