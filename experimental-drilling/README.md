# Experimental-drilling
Methodology for further mining and drilling of experimental data.

## Business issues
- Impact Link: What is the impact path of the strategy on business indicators?
- Sensitive groups: Who are the sensitive groups of the strategy, and which users are more likely to generate revenue from strategy optimization?
- Non experimental strategy evaluation: If a strategy is launched without conducting experiments, how can we understand its impact on business indicators?

## How to solve problems?
### Data driven value presentation

| Demand scenario | Input | Output | Analytical ability |
|:---------------:|-------|--------|--------------------|
| The AB experimental strategy has an impact on the core indicators, and what is the mechanism of the impact of the strategy on the core indicators? | 1. Target indicators (business indicators for target improvement).<br>2. Intervention indicators (experimental strategies that require assessing business value).<br>3. User characteristics (optional, attributes that may affect value). | 1. The impact path of experimental strategies on core indicators.<br>2. Decoupling the impact of various intervention indicators on business indicators. | SCM scheme based on AB experiment. |
| Which users are more sensitive to performance indicators and have more opportunities to earn profits? | 1. Target indicators (business indicators for target improvement).<br>2. Intervention indicators (work indicators that require judgment of business value).<br>3. Confusion indicators (potential factors affecting value judgments).<br>4. User characteristics (attributes that may have an impact on value). | Sensitive user characteristics. | RCM+CATE scheme based on observation data/AB experiments. |
| If the strategy achieves full volume without conducting experiments and it is difficult to roll back the experiment, is it expected to understand whether the strategy has an impact on business indicators? | 1. Target indicators (business indicators for target improvement).<br>2. Strategy pushes the entire timeline.<br>3. Characteristics related to target indicators. | The degree of impact of strategy on business indicators. | RCM scheme based on observation data. |
