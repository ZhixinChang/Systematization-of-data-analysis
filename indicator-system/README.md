Methodology for constructing an indicator system.

## Simple indicator system construction ideas
The premise of all data analysis is inseparable from indicators. If something cannot be measured by indicators, then its performance cannot be judged. Therefore, the construction of an indicator system is crucial for analysts to understand product and user performance.

- Indicator stratification: Ensure that there are corresponding indicators to measure from macro to micro scenarios, and good stratification can help businesses better monitor indicator changes and attribution.
- User perspective: By immersing oneself in the user perspective, fully understanding the user's goals in using the product, inferring factors that may affect core business indicators during use, and determining whether there are existing indicators to measure these factors. If not, it indicates that the current indicator system still needs improvement.
- Product perspective: Similar to the user perspective, fully understand the core objectives of the product, infer the factors that may affect the core business indicators of the product during user use, and determine whether there are existing indicators to measure these factors. If not, it indicates that the current indicator system still needs improvement.
